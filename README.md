# Discord Rev Shell

**Discord Rev Shell** is a simple yet powerful Discord bot designed to allow users to execute shell commands directly from a Discord channel. This functionality can be particularly useful for developers and system administrators who want to interact with their server's command line in a collaborative environment.

- **Display Outputs and Errors**: The bot captures the standard output and error streams, providing real-time feedback directly in Discord.
- **Customizable Command Prefix**: The command prefix can be easily modified to suit your preferences.
